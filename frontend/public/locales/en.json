    "q1": {
      "question": "What types of projects do you edit?",
      "answer": "I edit reels, vertical ads (9:16), product videos, UI videos and motion graphics for social and web. I handle short-form (15–60s) and longer pieces (up to 10 min), always focused on conversion and storytelling."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How long does delivery take?",
      "answer": "It depends on type, duration and complexity. A simple reel can be delivered in a few days; motion-graphics-heavy projects take longer. I confirm exact timing after receiving your brief."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What do I need to send to start?",
      "answer": "A brief with objectives and references; raw video files (.mp4/.mov); logos/vector files; fonts (if applicable); a script or timestamps; music/licenses. If something's missing, I'll provide a checklist."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "What formats and deliverables do you include?",
      "answer": "Standard delivery: master .mp4 (web-ready), vertical/horizontal versions if needed, and SRT subtitle files on request. I can also prepare mini-clips for thumbnails or platform-specific adaptations."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Do you include revisions?",
      "answer": "Yes — 2 rounds of revisions included in the base price (rhythm, color, micro-edits). Major restructures are charged separately."
